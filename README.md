# Control of three-dimensional Rayleigh-Bénard convection using multi-agent reinforcement learning
This is the official repository for Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for the control of three-dimensional (3D) Rayleigh-Bénard convection (RBC) using the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The DRL library used is [Tensorforce]([url](https://tensorforce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) and the numerical solver used for the CFD is the package [shenfun]([url](https://shenfun.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

All code material for this repository will be released upon publication of our recently submitted manuscript.
